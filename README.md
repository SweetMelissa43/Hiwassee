    <h1>Funyaking the Hiwassee</h1>
    <p>The headwaters of the Hiwassee River originate in North Carolina and North Georgia. It flows west into Tennessee and eventually merges with the Tennessee River. The Tennessee Valley Authority dams the Hiwassee River for production of hydroelectric power, forming Lake Chatuge, Appalachia Lake and Hiwassee Lake in North Carolina. The Hiwassee passes through the Cherokee National Forest and the historic towns of Reliance, Delano, Charleston, and Calhoun before emptying into the Tennessee River at Blythe's Ferry. The upper stretch of the river features mild whitewater rapids which carry down to the lower portions of the river which are more flatwater. The rapids are not too intense as whitewater would be but it offers enough rift for a slight thrill with relaxing portions of water that drift you downwards.</p>
